/* The code is defining a TypeScript constant called `NUMBER` that contains a set of key-value pairs.
Each key represents a number and each value represents the corresponding numerical value. For
example, `POINT_FIVE` is assigned the value `0.5`, `ZERO` is assigned the value `0`, `ONE` is
assigned the value `1`, and so on. These constants can be used throughout the code to represent
specific numerical values in a more readable and maintainable way. */
